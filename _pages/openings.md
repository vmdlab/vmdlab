# Open positions

**Note that we are NOT accepting research students currently. (Resarch Student is a position mainly for a student who tries to enroll in our graduate courses through the coming exams. It is different from a typical short-term position such as visiting or exchange students, for which we might accept some students if the situation permits.)**

We are  looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

### Favorable skill
Programming, math, strong motivation


### Lab tour
We recommend candidate students to contact professors of their preferred labs in advance of the entrance exam to discuss research topics (not mandatory). We would like to discuss in some depth, so before the individual interviews, please be prepared to talk about one paper that our laboratory has published to date that is of interest to you.

### For prospective Ph.D students
We expect Ph.D course applicants to have enough skills and experiences to do research independently. Therefore, we require the applicants to have at least one paper accepted at middle-level (or higher-level) conferences or journals in our field, as the minimum requirement. For example, the conferences listed [here](http://www.guide2research.com/topconf/). Otherwise, we recommend to join the Master's course first.
